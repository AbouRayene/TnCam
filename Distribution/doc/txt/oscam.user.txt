NAME
       oscam.user - user configuration file for OSCam

SYNOPSIS
       The user configuration file for OSCam contains user definitions. [account] sections in oscam.user are recurring
       (more than one account).

DESCRIPTIONS
   The [account] section
       user = name
	  account name, required

       pwd = password
	  password for account, required

       hostname = hostname
	  host from which user connection is allowed

       betatunnel = <CAID>.<ServiceID>:<target CAID>[,<CAID>.<ServiceID>: <target CAID>]...
	  define Betacrypt tunneling (max. see CS_MAXTUNTAB in globals.h).  The ServiceID can also be used  for  wild‚Äê
	  carded CAIDs.

	   example: betatunnel = 0100.0001:0200,0300.0004:0500
		    betatunnel = 0600.FFFF:0700

       uniq = 0|1|2|4
	  unique level:
	   0 = disabled, default
	   1 = only one connection per user is allowed
	   2 = set user to fake if source ip is different
	       (e.g. for newcamd clients with different CAIDs and ports)
	   3 = only one connection per user, but only the last login
	       will survive (old mpcs behavior)
	   4 = set user only to fake if source ip is different,
	       but only the last login will survive

       sleep = minutes
	  time waiting for inactive user, default:none

       sleepsend = 0|255

	  of camd3 client, default:0

       caid = <CAID>[&<mask>][:<CAID>[&<mask>]...
	  limit CAIDs, default:all CAIDs, required

	  example: caid = 0100&ffff:0200:0300&ff00

       au = label of reader|1
	  AU setting:
	    label of reader = sending EMMs to specified reader
			      (security issue: client can see SC data!)
	    1		    = auto AU is sending EMMs to all readers
			      (security issue: client can see SC data!)
	    default:none

       group = group[,<group>]...
	  user assingment to reader group, default=none, required

       services = [!]services[,[!]<services>]...
	  user [de]assingment to service group, default:none

       ident = <CAID>:<ident>[,<ident>,...][;<CAID>:<ident>[,<ident>,...]]...
	  user assingment to idents, default:none

       class = [!]class[,[!]class]...
	  user [de]assingment to classes, default=none

	   example: class = 01,02,!03,!04

       chid = <CAID>:<ChID>[,<CAID>:<ChID>]...
	  user assingment to Irdeto ChID, default:none

       monlevel = 0|1|2|3|4
	  monitor level:

	   0 = no access to monitor
	   1 = only server and own procs
	   2 = all procs, but viewing only, default
	   3 = all procs, reload of oscam.user possible
	   4 = complete access

       expdate = <year>-<month>-<day>|<year>/<month>/<day>
	  expiration date for account, default:none

	   example: expdate = 2001-11-21
		    expdate = 2002/12/22

       disabled = 0|1
	  1 = account disabled, default:0

       allowedtimeframe = hh:mm-hh:mm
	  account enabled from hh:mm to hh:mm, default:none

       numusers = quantity (only if anti-cascading enabled)
	  anti-cascading: user per account, 0 = anti-cascading disabled, default:0

       penalty = 0|1|2 (only if anti-cascading enabled)
	  level of penalty:

	   0 = only logging (default)
	   1 = send fake CWs
	   2 = disbable user temporary

       failban = 0|2|4
	  mask for IP based blocking:

	   0 = ignore (default)
	   2 = block IP of a disabled account on connecting
	   4 = block IP of a sleeping account while sleeping comes up

       suppresscmd08 = 0|1
	  0 = CMD08 for camd3 3.57x/3.78x clients enabled, 1 = CMD08 for camd3 3.57x/3.78x clients disabled, default:0

       keepalive = 0|1
	  0 = disable keepalive between server and client connection, default:1

       cccmaxhops = hops
	  maximum hops limit for CCcam clients, default:10

       cccreshare = level
	  reshare level for CCcam clients, default:10

	  -1 = no resharing
	   x = resharing for direct peer and share level x

	pwd	   = password
	group	   = 1
	au	   = myserialmousereader
